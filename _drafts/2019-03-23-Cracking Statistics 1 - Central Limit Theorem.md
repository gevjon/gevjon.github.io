From my personal learning experience, statistic just has toooo many concepts and theories to remember, and are just tooo hard to remember. However, knowing the practical use cases of that specific theory really helps me out not only with the remembering part, but also connecting all chose concepts together to form the ultimate roadmap.

So in this series, I'm going to discuss some major topics in statistics, try to bring the abstract theories down to the earth, so we can make friends with them but not fear of them. Let's start with the most commonly cited theorem: Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

--------

What central limit theory talks about is that, when the sample size is large enough (usually larger or equal to 30), then the __sample mean__ will more or less follow a __normal distribution__.
