### About Me
My name is Yin. I love painting, photography and listening to podcast. But honestly, I'm an engineering student.

I do engineering because it's accurate, precise, and more deliverable. But all in all, art and science are just two ways of exploring the world. So I'd rather describe myself as an __EXPLORER__.

Being an explorer, I'd like to spend my time **seeing** the beauty of the world, and **building** funny stuffs, which can be accomplished by the power of data and code blocks. That's why I'm intrigued by the fantasy of computer science and data science now.

---------------------------
### Past Experience
I used to work as an assistant product manager at [Shanbay](https://www.shanbay.com/), where I really enjoyed working with a group of aspiring young people, and building/polishing products that really matters to language learners in China.

Recently I'm a graduate assistant working as the grader for CS411 - Database Systems for two semesters.

More Personally, I used to work as a personal tutor, interned in the branch of the Provincial Transportation Design Institute, and sold ice-cream in Jiangsu Broadcasting Building. And I volunteer a lot üôãüèª, like organizing Engineering Outreach Activities in the community of U of I‚Äç.

### Academic History
I'm currently a master candidate from [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), studying data analytics and management. I receieved my bachelor's degree of Transportation Engineering in [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) as a member in the class of Yisheng Mao, and finished my master's degree under the supervision of [Professor Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=55tnR_sAAAAJ&hl=en).
