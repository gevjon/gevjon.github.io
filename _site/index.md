### About Me
My name is Yin. I love painting, photography and listening to podcast. But honestly, I'm an engineering student. 

I do engineering because it's accurate, precise, more deliverable. But all in all, art and science are just twos ways of exploring the world. So I'd rather describe myself as an explorer. 

In that case, I'm pretty interested in **seeing** the beauty and functioning of our world in a data-driven manner, and **building** the suprising stuffs like in a minecraft world by programming. It's all about experience and celebrating the life to me.


### Past Experience
I used to work as an assistant product manager at [Shanbay](https://www.shanbay.com/), where I really enjoyed working with a group of aspiring young people. Recently I'm a graduate assistant working as the grader for CS411 for two semesters. 

More Personally, I used to work as a personal tutor, interned in the branch of the Provincial Transportation Design Institute, and selled ice-cream in Jiangsu Broadcasting Building. And I volunteer a lot üôãüèª‚Äç!

### Academic History
I'm currently a master candidate from [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), studying data analytics and management. I receieved my bachelor's degree of Transportation Engineering in [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) as a member of the class of Yisheng Mao, and finished my master's degree under the supervision of [Professor Liu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=55tnR_sAAAAJ&hl=en).
